## Installation

Simple git clone my respositiory to your local, `npm i` to install all dependencies, and then `npm start` to start the application!

## Usage

You'll be able to track how well you're saving by adding and subtracting income.
As well as being a nice web application, this will also be able to be used while offline, in case of emergencies.
When the internet is restored, any stored data that was used offline on the application will then be submitted to your online submissions.

## Contributing

You can add on to my project as much as you'd like.
